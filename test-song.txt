blah blah blah

In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packing up my shit
As much shit in the car as I can fit 
And I'm just driving as far as I can get
Away from these problems, 'til all my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like, 'cause tonight I'm starting life again
Get to the corner and stop, f*ck am I going
Besides sight going when I fantasize
Starting my whole life over, yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothing like
Holding your head up high when you're dead inside
And I just hide so in, case you're wondering why my insides showing
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so I'm
Picking them up and stuff them in the back
F*ck it I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery brought me nothing
But back, to right where I was and perhaps, this could've been my victory lap
If I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

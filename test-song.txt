In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packing up my shit
As much shit in the car as I can fit 
And I'm just driving as far as I can get
Away from these problems, 'til all my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like, 'cause tonight I'm starting life again
Get to the corner and stop, f*ck am I going
Besides sight going when I fantasize
Starting my whole life over, yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothing like
Holding your head up high when you're dead inside
And I just hide so in, case you're wondering why my insides showing
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so I'm
Picking them up and stuff them in the back
F*ck it I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery brought me nothing
But back, to right where I was and perhaps, this could've been my victory lap
If I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

What's in your head, in your head

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It seems to be the reoccurring main thing
The shit I would daydream as a kid I was 18
I went from an irate teenager
Still raging as adult, amazing
Back then I put everything into the 
Rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy, or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it (did what?) Hailie
Baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe, I should've did a better job at separating
Shady, and entertaining, from real life, but this
Dang thing, is still the hardest thing to explain
Is the crazy, or should I ever seen it back then
It was like I ain't even bother taking into consideration
You and baby and older and making me say things
I did it, yay me, and be, it just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentle, men let's strip away everything
And see the main reason that I, feel like a lame piece of shit
(Or should I?) sound cranky and bitter
Complain beef and bicker about the same things
'Cause when I look at me I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get a, way and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
